# Browser extension for intercepting traffic

## Description

Couldn't find a simple code that intercepts traffic and works in multiple browsers? Me neither! But you're in luck. This repo might serve as a boilerplate for getting that juicy requests. Enjoy!

It intercepts requests and displays their count.

Tested in Chromium and Firefox.
